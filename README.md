# Trapezoidal-Integration-Method

主要思路为面积累加法，对一段函数积分，即为求其梯形面积，设定一个精度值，若其一次求取与区间划分后(一个划分为两个)之差小于大于精度值，则继续划分，小于则得到结果

The main idea is the area accumulation method. To integrate a function, that is, to calculate its trapezoidal area, set an accuracy value. If the difference between its one-time calculation and the interval division (one divided into two) is less than or greater than the accuracy value, continue the division, and if less than, obtain the result
